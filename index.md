## Communication

We make announcements on lectures and seminars and are glad to answer your questions regarding theory or homework.

Also for each launch we provide two Telegram resour—Åes:
* Alerts channel
     announcements of important events: schedule changing, deadlines, etc.
     read this channel regularly to stay tuned
* Course chat
    answers to your questions, course topic discussions and so on
We do advise you to join both of them, relevant links are available on level pages.

### Rules

We ask you:
- don't flood: chat contains lots of people - respect their time and attention.
    This especially regards tutors because we try to carefully read and respond to every message.
- don't spoil homework solutions. Discuss common approaches or specific topics.
- don't use foul language (including stickers), don't be rude. Respect each other, be constructive.
- try not to write direct messages to tutors because you are numerous but we are not. If you want to call particular person or draw attention use `@mention`

Messages violating this rules will be deleted, infringers will be banned.
